Project Overview

This project is conducted under the supervision of Agnès Ferté and Andrés Plazas. Our goal is to determine the optimal configurations for computing the angular power spectrum with sufficient precision while minimizing computational time and avoiding unnecessary resource usage.

In this repository, you will find the *Y1* folder, which contains lsst_simulate.ini, lsst_analyze.ini, and lsst_value.ini. The settings in these .ini files were specifically chosen to obtain the LSST Year 1 data vector following the DESC SRD guidelines.
